The rest of the scenarios which need custom Tab handling (like Mover and Groupper just mentioned above) add special invisible dummy inputs around the particular area. The default action will move focus to that dummy input and once the dummy input is focused, Tabster decides what actual element needs to be focused and redirects the focus.

Tabster has the cross origin part which allows forwarding some particular events between the IFrames. For example, Tabster has a thing called Keyboard Navigation State \u2014 a boolean flag (and event to observe) telling if the user is using keyboard to navigate instead of mouse. With the cross origin module this state will be automatically synchronized between iframes, so when you start tabbing in one iframe, the other one automatically knows you're navigating with keyboard. There are also other cool possibilities like cross origin ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/docs/observed"},"Observed Element API")," when you can give an element a name in one ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"<iframe>")," and focus that element from another ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"<iframe>")," by name (or get events when that element appears in the DOM).
